# openhab-binding-jade

This is a binding for the openHAB / eclipse Smart Home home automation system. It aims to provide a container of the JADE agent framework, so own agents can be developed and run in it and work as an adapter to the agent world, e.g. other smart home instances.

Development has just started, so the binding is not really functioning yet. The first step will be to make JADE itself start, then a test agent. Next will be an example implementation using an energy agent from EOM (energy option model, see http://agent-hygrid.net)

This is intended to show it around to other people who might be interested and collect testers, reviewers and contributors who maybe also have other OSes than Linux.

What is already working:
* nothing

What is not yet working
* everything
